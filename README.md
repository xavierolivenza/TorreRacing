# TorreRacing

This project is one of our own to put into practice Bullet Physics Library.

TorreRacing is a game in which you are a cow named NOT, and your objective is to reach your barn. You are not friends with the chickens, so you don't really care about running over them, in fact, it may be usefull for you!

This project is being done by 2 students of CITM Terrassa (Catalonia/Spain), with C++, SDL 2.0 and Bullet Physics Library.

## Installation

Unzip the realese folder and execute the .exe file.

A ➣ Turn left.

##Win lose condition

Win ➣ Get as low time as you can and end the race making your way into the barn. Running over a chicken lowers your time 2 sec.

Lose ➣ Fell off the circuit to the void.


##Warning

Hardly ever the vehicle velocity becomes nan (int the title it will show up as 0) and the car fly away and the screen becomes black, close and restart the .exe.

Sometimes some chickens may fly away extremely fast, we hope that doesn't bother you.

We are sorry for the inconviniences.
